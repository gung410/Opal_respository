# Tutorial: Get started with OPAL2.0

## Mobile technical requirement

| **Concern**                         | **Analysis Report**                |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Screen size and resolution          | I think it's full support because I don't see a specific number of the screen size in the tender requirement.
| Memory and storage space of the app | Low memory use, because the current app doesn't have the feature to download courses for offline viewing, but we could use some 50-200 MB cache storage for cache lesson content at a time.
| CPU performance                     | It has low CPU need. Exception maybe when playing video lesson.
| Specific hard ware                  | In later phase, we may however optionally use at least camera. but not for MVP.
| OS version should support           | In the tender requirement, it says "supports at least the latest and last two versions of Apple iOS and Google Android â€“ this would be confirmed at the Requirements Gathering phase", but  Vile                                            think "iOS that's version 10 and above and Android 7 above".

## Web browsers requirement

| **Browser**        | **Version**                                         |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Internet Explorer  | 11 and above
| Safari             | 9 and above for Mac OS
| Safari             | 10 and above for IOS
| Google Chrome      | 50 and above for Windows PC, Mac OSX, IOS and Android
