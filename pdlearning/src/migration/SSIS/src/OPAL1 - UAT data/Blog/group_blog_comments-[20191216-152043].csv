<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: medium;""><em>The earlier session has been very enriching &amp; enlightening. I feel very happy to be part of this project, believing that my children can definitely benefit from lesson carefully planned by dedicated teachers, with the support &amp; guidance from many knowledgeable others. As we were working to plan the lesson, I realise that I have taken many things for granted and made many assumptions as I teach... not knowing the importance of &lsquo;unpacking&rsquo; even the most basic terms used. My greatest take away; As teachers, teaching our children how to&nbsp; do something is important. But in the process of teaching &amp; learning, teachers play an even more crucial role of guiding children to verbalise their thinking, rationalise their act and monitor their own learning as this will go a long way to help the children become self-directed, lifelong learners... I look forward to carry out our lesson in my class ^_^ and i can&rsquo;t wait to hear their responses to the &lsquo;higher-order-thinking&rsquo; questions....Hope I don&rsquo;t faint...</em></span></p>","1008186","2012-11-08 20:28:50"

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">The lesson provides pupils ample opportunities to use manipulative in solving the questions and articulate their reasoning to crystallise their thoughts and understanding of the concepts. Pupils learn through &ldquo;doing&rdquo; a particular task. They need to communicate their knowledge and reason it out. Through repeatedcommunication and reasoning, it may help pupils to reinforce their understanding. I like these sentence starters &ldquo;I think it is because&hellip;&rdquo;, &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s right because &hellip;.&rdquo;, &ldquo;I disagree with you because &hellip;..&rdquo;. I will continue to encourage pupils to build on one another&rsquo;s thinking/ knowledge.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Getting pupils to pay attention to things around them is a skill that they must inculcate from young. They need to know where to look for information and be proactive in their learning. It would be good to have the teacher&rsquo;s (that&rsquo;s me!) modelling (concepts written on butcher paper) be displayed in the classroom. This will help to scaffold the concepts. Pupils will tap on it to do their group / individual work. I look forward to a more conducive learning environment....</span></p>","1008186","2012-11-08 20:30:23"

The discussions gave us a better understanding of how to go about preparing a differentiated lesson. &lsquo;Packing&rsquo; and &lsquo;unpacking&rsquo; concepts, terms and appropriate vocab for the lesson to suit the varied learners in class. Creating opportunity for the pupils to learn through doing, articulate and communicate their reasoning so that their learning becomes clearer to them. The dedicated team of teachers.....Inspiring!</span></p>","1008186","2012-11-08 20:31:26"
