    "IntroText": "The Professional Development Planner Module (PDPM) supports MOE staff to identify their Learning Needs and to plan their professional development activities (e.g. courses, seminars, conferences, learning journeys etc.). The planning is done in collaboration with the Learner's Approving/Reporting Officer, and the goal is to develop and enhance job competencies of each member of the staff. This is called MPJ - My Professional Development Journey. Division Learning Coordinators and School Staff Developers uses the PDPM to perform Learning Needs Analysis and can chart the learning directions of each organisation (schools and HQ divisions), plan the Organisational PD Journey and then cascade the Organisational PD Journey to the relevant staff members. This is called OPJ - Organisation Professional Development Journey.",
